            Overview
                In the Guess My Number game the computer picks a magic
                number, and then the user tries to guess it. After each 
                guess, the computer tells the user to guess "higher" or 
                "lower" until they guess the magic number.

                This assignment is a little tricky, because it brings 
                together many of the concepts you've learned in this course 
                including loops and if statements.

                - the third is an increment step that is run at the end of each loop
